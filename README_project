Demo Program: sata (bin/sata/sata.c)

We implemented read/write/seek and create an image file
called demo.img with preloaded dirs and a file.
The struct of demo.img is:

.
..
test_dir -> dir which points to .
test_dir2
   |
   |-- test_file -> a 8192 bytes file
   
You can run "sata" in the shell to read/write the test_file.
Changes to this file will be written back to the image file.

Limitations:
The file cannot be extended, and we didn't implement 
cp/mkdir/rm so you cannot create/delete files/directories.


SATA/file system related code:
sys/fd_file.c
sys/ahci.c
sys/pci.c
sys/sbfs.c
sys/vfs.c

-----------------------------------------------------------

Demo Program: sleep (bin/sleep/sleep.c)

We implemented printf and scanf. for scanf, only %d and %s
(without and modifier) are supported.

-----------------------------------------------------------

Demo Program: stdio (bin/stdio/stdio.c)

We implemented printf and scanf. for scanf, only %d and %s
(without and modifier) are supported. User input will be
read from STDIN and write to STDOUT.
